\section{Concluding Remarks and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion-future_work}
This section is not to be considered final and is subject to change in future revisions.

The configuration of the quality attribute \texttt{Precision} described in \cref{subsec:cqa}has been added to
RabbitMQ FMU due to experiments. In co-simulations with no relation to elements
external to the co-simulation, the imprecision of floating-point numbers in
relation to communication from master to slave will be the same throughout.
However, once slaves are communicating with the external world, this becomes a
very important consideration and can lead to discrepancies as presented in \cref{sec:example-watertank}.

The immediate future work is related to experiments, i.e. as described in
\cref{sec:example-lfr}. It is expected that such experiments will lead to
additional requirements.
